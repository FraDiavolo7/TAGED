# Phazing

Phazing moves are moves that make the opponent switch out, including [[Whirlwind]], [[Roar]], [[Dragon Tail]], and [[Circle Throw]].

The word "phaze" is short for "pseudo-Haze", since they're similar to [[Haze]] in that they reset stat boosts.

Note that the Ability [[Suction Cups]] and the effect of [[Ingrain]] prevent phazing.
